## What This Is

**commerce-atoms** is a home for **modular, framework-agnostic commerce tooling**.

Projects focus on **pure business logic**, not UI: designed to be composed, audited, and reused across storefronts without vendor lock-in.

## Projects

### [`shoppy`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/shoppy)

Pure commerce utilities monorepo. Independent npm packages: variants, filters, urlstate, money, seo, metafield, cart, discounts, pagination, date.

### [`hydrogen-storefront-starter`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/hydrogen-storefront-starter)

Production-ready Shopify Hydrogen starter with reference architecture.

### [`agents`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/agents)

AI assistance: editor rules (Cursor, Copilot) and expert personas.

### [`mcp-hydrogen-kit`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/mcp-hydrogen-kit)

MCP tools for Hydrogen: route discovery, schema lookup, architecture validation.

## Principles

- **Composable by design** — small units, no monoliths
- **Pure business logic** — no UI, no framework assumptions
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — predictable, auditable, tree-shakable
- **Explicit APIs** — no barrels, no magic imports
- **TypeScript-first** — strict, structural typing
- **Delete-able** — safe to remove without rewrites
- **ESM-only** — modern, future-facing tooling

## What This Org Is _Not_

- ❌ UI component libraries
- ❌ Framework abstractions
- ❌ Runtime state managers
- ❌ Opinionated app architecture
- ❌ Vendor lock-in layers

## Philosophy

commerce-atoms is intentionally **boring** in the best way:

- No runtime magic
- No hidden behavior
- No opinionated architecture imposed on apps

Everything is explicit, inspectable, and replaceable.
