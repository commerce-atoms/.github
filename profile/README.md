# commerce-atoms

> **Composable commerce building blocks** — small, focused modules for modern storefronts.

Modular, framework-agnostic commerce tooling. Pure business logic, no UI. Designed to be composed, audited, and reused without vendor lock-in.

## Projects

- [`shoppy`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/shoppy) — Commerce utilities monorepo (variants, filters, urlstate, money, seo, etc.)
- [`hydrogen-storefront-starter`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/hydrogen-storefront-starter) — Production-ready Hydrogen starter
- [`agents`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/agents) — AI assistance (editor rules, expert personas)
- [`mcp-hydrogen-kit`](https://github.com/commerce-atoms/mcp-hydrogen-kit) — ⚠️ Alpha — MCP tools for Hydrogen

## Principles

Composable by design • Pure business logic • Zero runtime dependencies • Explicit APIs • TypeScript-first • Delete-able • ESM-only

**Not:** UI libraries, framework abstractions, runtime state managers, opinionated architecture, vendor lock-in.
